/*
 * Subjects are multicast, meaning instead of each new subscriber
 * creating it's own execution path, subscribers are instead
 * registered to the subject, with each being delivered the same
 * notifications as the occur.
 * 
 * To see this more clearly, let's create an interval observable.
 * We can also add on a console.log for each time the
 * interval emits.

 * 'new interval' is being emitted twice.
 */
// interval$.subscribe(observer);
// interval$.subscribe(observer);

/*
 * With a subject, we can share this execution by
 * first subscribing the subject to the interval$
 * observable, then subscribing to that subject.
 * 
 * Remember, Subjects are observers with next methods,
 * so you can subscribe it directly to another observable.
 */
// interval$.subscribe(subject);

/*
 * This method of sharing an execution is so common
 * that RxJS offers a variety of operators which use subjects
 * behind the scenes to turn a typical unicast observable
 * into a multicast observable. We will explore these in detail
 * in the subsequent lessons.
